# gazeR

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/andy0682/gazeR.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/andy0682/gazeR)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of gazeR is to identify visual fixations from eye-tracking data with Density Based Clustering.
For now the only tool is based on the dbscan algorithm (from the dbscan library).

Here is a brief description of the package implementation procedure:

* The package and its documentations were initiated in Rstudio with the devtools and roxygen2 libraries.
* An initial Unit Test Protocol was implemented with the testthat library.
* Final full check (as with R cmd check) was performed with the devtools::check() function.
* The packages was then pushed to this GitHub repository.
* Continuous integration with Travis was implemented via github_actions (https://app.travis-ci.com/github/andy0682/gazeR)

## Installation

You can install this version under development of gazeR from:
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("andy0682/gazeR")
```
For the moment the package has only one function: gazeClusters(dat, eps, minPts = 5, recRate = NULL)

If you download the package, you can see the function documentation by typing ?gazeClusters in the console.
